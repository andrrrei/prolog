# Prolog Course Project

This repository contains projects completed during a Prolog programming course. The course consisted of two main parts:

## Part 1: Prolog Predicate Implementation
- Focused on implementing individual predicates to solve various logical problems.
- The predicates and their descriptions are provided in the **`prt1`** folder.

## Part 2: Logical Puzzle Generator
- Developed a complete system to generate and solve geometric puzzles using Prolog.
- The system includes figure generation, puzzle creation, and an interactive GUI.
- Detailed information is provided in the **`prt2`** folder.
